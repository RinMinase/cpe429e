					My name is Kristian Daniel S. Alunan. I am currently twenty one years of age right now. I am currently enrolled in the University of San Carlos, located in Nasipit, Talamban, Cebu City. I am now studying up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Majoring in Software Engineering.

					<br><br>

					I like programming, because of the power of the developers or the programmers hold. One anime character once said, "Making an impossible task, possible, is a programmer's job" (Ryuunosuke A., Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo). I like programming because, whenever I'm given with a repetitive task at hand, I usually make some ways to make myself exert lesser effort in doing the next sets of repetitions. I seldom create small snippets of code to be able to make this task faster, more efficient, less effort done, and automated.

					Although this site totally does not reflect it, I myself like anime, as I consider this as one of my greatest pastimes even until now. I usually watch anime that is less mainstream, as I am not usually fond with mainstream ones. What I usually watch are mostly romance - comedy, or romance - drama themed anime. These types of anime are usually the least watched, and are not usually the ones that go mainstream.

					Although my website looks extremely bleak, I still welcome you to my humble website. Feel free to browse or look through some pages of my simple website. It's contents would include the welcome page, or this page respectively, a simple profile of me, and my class schedule for the first semester of the academic school year of 2016-17. I hope you will enjoy a bit of my simple website.
