						Konnichiwa!!

						My name is Kristian Daniel S. Alunan. I am currently twenty-one years of age right now. I am currently enrolled in the University of San Carlos, located in Nasipit, Talamban, Cebu City. I am now studying up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering majoring in Software Engineering.
					</p>

					<p>
						I like programming because of the power or the capability of a developer or a programmer holds. One anime character once said, "Making an impossible task, possible, is a programmer's job" (Ryuunosuke A., Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo). I like programming because whenever I'm given with a repetitive task at hand, I usually make some ways to make myself exert lesser effort in doing the next sets of repetitions, I sometimes create small snippets of code to be able to make that certain task, faster, more efficient, less effort done, somewhat automated, and perhaps better than before.
					</p>

						Although this site does not totally reflect it, I myself, just like on how I like anime, consider this a one of my greatest pastimes even until now. The anime I watch is something that is usually less mainstream or sometimes not mainstream at all, I as am usually not fond with the mainstream ones. I usually watch romance-comedy or romance-drama themed anime. These types of anime are usually the less likely watched and are not usually the ones.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also love playing mahjong (pronounced as MAHH-JONG). I got into playing this tile / board game from the anime Saki. I only played a few times in reality, and a lot of times from the internet. I don't play this for the money, or as they say, gambling; I only play this game for the fun and excitement in it as I draw and drop the tiles and while also winning the game. There was a time when I wanted to have my own set of tiles but figured not to when I saw its price up close, as the ones with good quality costs a fortune for me.
					</p>

						Although my website looks extremely bleak, I still welcome you to my humble website. Feel free to browse, or look through some pages of my simple website. Its contents would include a welcome page, or this page respectively. It also has my profile containing a very tiny description of what I really am. It contains a schedule of my classes for the academic school year of 2016 - 2017. And ultimately it also contains my activities for the subject ComE 429E. I hope you will enjoy a bit of my simple website.
